                <h2>About Me:</h2>
                <p>I am 31 years old, born and raised from Blooming Grove, New York.  
                    During and a little after high school I had a bit of odd jobs being a camp counselor, lifeguard and working at Godiva Chocolate.
                    I have been in the Marine Corps for almost 12 years (joined November 2012) and I am now going to school to become a commissioned officer.  
                    My first job was as a Military Police.  I have been stationed in several places including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Quantico, Virginia with Presidential Helicopter Squadron.</li>
                        <li>Okinawa, Japan with 3rd Law Enforcement Battalion</li>
                        <li>Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Caralina as a Drill Instructor</li>
                        <li>University of Colorado-Boulder NROTC as a student</li>
                    </ul>  
                <p>
                  I have a 4 year old mut, Pebbles.  I've had her for about two and half years now and she is basically my shadow.  
                  I enjoy doing anything and everything outdoors. That includes, paddle boarding, kayaking, hiking, backpacking, biking.
                  One of my biggest passions is to travel.  So far, not counting the 3 countries I plan on visiting in 2025, I have been to 22 countries.
                  I am only missing South America and Antartica to have travelled to every continent.  South America is getting crossed off January 2025.  
                  I have very little experience with website design but excited to learn!
