<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>I am 31 years old, born and raised from Blooming Grove, NY.  I have been in the Marine Corps for almost 12 years and now going to school to become a commissioned officer.
I have very little experience with website design but excited to learn!  I have a 4 year old mut, Pebbles.  I enjoy doing anything and everything outdoors.
