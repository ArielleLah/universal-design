    <h3>Interoperability</h3>
      <p>Interoperability is a basic principle that our websites should work on any device, browser or computer platform.  This means there should be a seemless transition between desktop, tablets, mobile phones, but also adapt to which platform is being used. This is important because most people now barely even use laptops and strictly use their phone.  Having Interoperability into your design allows you to reach as many people as possible.</p>
    <h3>Goal of Universal Design</h3>
      <p>The goal of Universal Design is to ensure that <em>ALL</em> people can use our websites.  The way to ensure this happens is to remember that every person's abilities range within a spectrum from able to do a task effortlessly to not being able to do a task at all, and everywhere in between. </p>
    <h3>Allows Search Engine Optimization</h3>
      <p>Search Engine Optimization means following a universal and accessible design of your website, it will put you above other websites.  For example, your website could be the first or second ones within a google search and a bad designed website could be at the bottom or even second page.  </p>
    <h3>Universal Design thought of early and throughout</h3>
      <p>Keeping Universal Design as forethought at the start of the design process allows you to save money as well as have a cohesive design that is also accessible, instead of a "band-aid" fix.  For example, if you've ever seen the attached wheel chair ramps that was definitely an afterthought, they could've saved themselves the eye sore if it was an integral part of their design and websites are no different. </p>
    <h3>Disabilites are Everywhere</h3>
      <p>20% of Americans have a disability that impairs access to websites and internet content from 2000. This number has only increased with the advance of medicine allowing people to live longer lives, but probably with some form of disability.  People experience varying degrees of auditory, cognitive, physical, speech and visual disabilities.  For example, someone could be color blind and need that color contrast built into the site or everything just blends together and is irreadable.  If we approach the design as user-centered, we can think about different aspects of disabilities that could possibly be a hinderence.  For example, some aspects include age-related impairments, multiple disabilities, health conditions (dexterity, concentration, or stamina), changing abilities, temporary impairments (broken arm), or situational limitations (noisy room).</p>

    <h3>Benefits of Web Standards</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Using Web standards, allow pages to be lighter and smaller which use less bandwidth and save on storage.</li>
        <li>File size is reduced because there is no need of "code forking", because you only need one set of code for all browsers.</li>
        <li>It requires less time to edit because you are only using CSS.</li>
        <li>External style sheets allows the developer to offer various styles to their users.</li>
        <li>This design allows the content of a site to appear effectively on different size viewports/devices in a manner that meets particular needs.</li>
        <li>Improves search engine optimization and makes your website more available through search engines.</li>
        <li>Easier for Assitive Technology to be able to read the content of a page when following the right structure and coding.</li>
        <li>A standards-compliant page encourages accessibility by requiring the use of alt text for image and graphic elements.</li>
        <li>External CSS is more useful to control the overall presentation of a site, and allow much easier site-wide changes.</li>
