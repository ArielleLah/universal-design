      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>This article critically examines the evolution and current state of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education, focusing on the intersection of transdisciplinary approaches, ideological forces, and the pressing need for diversification.</p>
      <p>Through an extensive review of educational data, literature, and case studies, this study, A Critical Examination of STEM Education, reveals how traditional STEM education, while successful in promoting technical skills and innovation, often neglects broader social and ethical dimensions.</p>
      <p>The research highlights significant demographic disparities within STEM fields. It argues that these disparities are reinforced by underlying ideological biases. Some of these biases stem from historical teaching methods that didn’t really capture the learner's intent to choose STEM education options, rather, that prioritize economic outcomes over inclusivity and critical thinking. The findings underscore the importance of integrating the arts and social sciences into STEM education to foster a more inclusive, well-rounded, and socially responsible educational model.</p>
      <p>It concludes with a call to action for educators, policymakers, and institutions to embrace a more diversified and transdisciplinary approach to STEM education, ensuring its relevance and accessibility to all students.</p>

      <h2>Methodologies</h2>
      <h3>1. Quantitative Analysis</h3>
        <p>&bull; Data Collection</p> <!--needed bullet point-->
          <p>National education databases, including the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), were utilized to gather data on STEM enrollment, graduation rates, and career outcomes over the past decade. It is noted that there is a significant bias towards enrollment of STEM students. The majority, male tend to have more interest , but this has changed over the last decade or so. With numbers of female students being encouraged to take up interest and enroll in the same.</p>
        <p>&bull; Statistical Techniques</p> <!--needed bullet point-->
          <p>A series of statistical analyses were performed to identify trends and correlations.</p>
          <p>Here's an example:</p>
        <strong>Study Objective</strong> <!--Bolded-->
          <p>To investigate the factors influencing student interest and performance in STEM subjects among high school students.</p>
        <strong>Data Collection</strong>
          <p>A survey was distributed to 1,000 high school students, collecting data on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Demographics: Age, gender, socioeconomic status</li>
          <li>Academic Performance: Grades in STEM subjects (math, biology, chemistry, physics)</li>
          <li>Extracurricular Activities: Participation in STEM clubs, competitions, and events</li>
          <li>Attitudes and Interests: Interest in STEM careers, self-efficacy in STEM subjects, and parental influence</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Statistical Analyses Conducted</h4>
        <strong>Descriptive Statistics</strong>
          <p>Calculated means, medians, and standard deviations for grades in STEM subjects. Generated frequency distributions for demographic variables and extracurricular participation.</p>
        <strong>Correlation Analysis</strong>
          <p>Used Pearson correlation coefficients to assess relationships between:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Participation in STEM extracurricular activities and academic performance in STEM subjects.</li>
          <li>Student self-efficacy and interest in STEM careers.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Regression Analysis</strong>
          <p>Conducted multiple regression analysis to determine the predicitve power of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Demographic factors (e.g., socioeconomic status) and extracurricular participation on STEM grades.</li>
          <li>Attitudinal factors (e.g., self-efficacy) on career interest in STEM fields.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong><abbr title="analysis of variance">ANOVA</abbr></strong>
          <p>ANOVA was used to compare mean STEM grades across different demographic groups (e.g., gender and socioeconomic status) to identify significant differences.</p>
        <strong>Chi-Square Test</strong>
          <p>Analyzed the relationship between gender and participation in STEM extracurricular activities to see if there were significant differences in involvement.</p>
      <h4>Findings</h4>
        <strong>Trends Identified</strong>
          <p>Higher participation in STEM extracurricular activities was associated with improved grades in STEM subjects. Students with higher self-efficacy reported greater interest in pursuing STEM careers.</p>
        <strong>Significant Correlations</strong>
          <p>A positive correlation (r = 0.65) was found between extracurricular participation and STEM grades. A significant gender difference in extracurricular participation was noted, with males participating more frequently than females (χ² = 10.45, p < 0.01).</p>
        <strong>Predicitive Factors</strong>
          <p>The regression model indicated that socioeconomic status and extracurricular participation together explained 35% of the variance in STEM grades.</p>
          <p>The analysis revealed important trends and correlations that can inform strategies to enhance STEM education and engagement among high school students. Future interventions might focus on increasing access to extracurricular STEM programs, particularly for underrepresented groups.</p>
          <p>This example outlines how various statistical techniques can be applied to examine trends and correlations in STEM education effectively.</p>
        <p>&bull; Regression Analysis</p>
          <p>Used to determine the relationship between students' socioeconomic backgrounds and their likelihood of pursuing and succeeding in STEM fields. The analysis revealed that students from the top income quartile (whose parents earn an average of $70,000 plus a per year), were 45% more likely to graduate with a STEM degree than those from the bottom quartile.</p>
        <p>&bull; ANOVA (analysis of variance)</p>
          <p>Applied to compare the academic performance and retention rates of different demographic groups within STEM programs. The results showed significant differences, with minority and female students having lower retention rates, particularly in engineering and computer science disciplines.</p>
        <p>&bull; Surveys</p>
          <p>Conducted with a sample size of 15 students and 3 educators (invariably a small figure however the aim was to ascertain that STEM was unequally absorbed), across various institutions, the surveys aimed to capture perceptions of STEM education’s inclusivity, relevance, and effectiveness. Key findings included that 65% of female students felt that STEM curricula did not adequately address social and ethical issues. In comparison, 72% of minority students reported feeling underrepresented and unsupported in their STEM studies.</p>
      <h3>2. Qualitative Analysis</h3>
        <p class="indent">&bull; Thematic Analysis</p>
          <p>Semi-structured interviews were conducted with educators, students, and industry professionals to explore the ideological underpinnings of STEM education. Thematic analysis identified recurring themes, such as the dominance of neoliberal ideologies, which emphasize competition, market-driven skills, and individual achievement over collective problem-solving and ethical considerations.</p>
        <p class="indent">&bull; Literature Review</p>
          <p>The literature review synthesized over 100 scholarly articles, policy documents, and historical analyses to trace the evolution of STEM education and its ideological influences. The review found that the rise of STEM in the post-Cold War era was closely linked to national security concerns and economic competitiveness, often sidelining broader educational goals.</p>  
        <p class="indent">&bull; Case Studies</p>
          <p>Comparative case studies were conducted on institutions that have successfully implemented transdisciplinary models, such as the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), which integrates arts into STEM (STEAM). These case studies highlighted improved student engagement, creativity, and the ability to tackle complex, interdisciplinary problems.</p>

      <h3>3. Ethical Considerations:</h3>
        <p class="indent">&bull; Anonymity and confidentiality</p>
          <p>To protect participants, all interviews were anonymized, and data was stored securely. Participants were informed of their right to withdraw from the study at any time.</p>
        <p class="indent">&bull; Bias mitigation</p>
          <p>To ensure the reliability of the findings, triangulation was used, combining data from surveys, interviews, and literature to cross-verify results and minimize researcher bias.</p>

    <section id="Findings">
      <h2>Findings</h2>
      <h3>1. Demographic Disparities in STEM:</h3>
        <p>The analysis revealed that female students comprised only 28% of the STEM workforce, with even lower representation in engineering (15%) and computer science (17%). Minority groups, particularly African American and Hispanic students, were similarly underrepresented, making up only 9% and 11% of the STEM workforce, respectively.</p>

          <figcaption>Pie Chart of Percentage of Female Students</figcaption> 
        </figure>
      <p class="indent">&bull; Socioeconomic disparities</p>
        <p>The regression analysis showed a strong correlation between students' socioeconomic status and their participation in STEM. Students from higher-income backgrounds were more likely to have access to advanced STEM resources, such as AP courses in high school, internships, and research opportunities, which contributed to their higher success rates in STEM education.</p>
      <h3>2. Ideological Influences:</h3>
      <p class="indent">&bull; Neoliberalism in STEM</p>
        <p>The thematic analysis of interviews revealed that many educators felt pressured to align their curricula with market demands, focusing on producing graduates with technical skills that meet industry needs.</p>
        <p>Institutions that are actively involved in this include:</p>
        <p><strong>Community Colleges:</strong> Many community colleges have strong partnerships with local industries and tailor their technical programs to meet specific workforce requirements. Examples include the California Community Colleges system and Miami Dade College.</p>
        <p><strong>Technical Institutes: </strong> Institutions like The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Georgia Institute of Technology often focus on engineering and technology programs that are closely aligned with current industry trends.</p>
        <p><strong>Universities with Strong Industry Ties:</strong> Schools such as Stanford University and Carnegie Mellon University have robust connections with the tech industry, helping to ensure their curricula remain relevant to market needs.</p> 
        <p><strong>Vocational Training Centers:</strong> Organizations like The American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) often promote programs that develop specific vocational skills that align with job market demands.</p>
        <p><strong>Online Education Platforms:</strong> Institutions like Coursera and edX, which partner with universities and companies, provide courses designed to meet specific skills gaps identified by employers.</p>
        <p><strong>Workforce Development Agencies:</strong> Local and regional agencies, such as Workforce Investment Boards, often collaborate with educational institutions to design curricula that prepare students for in-demand careers.</p>
        <p><strong>Private Technical Schools:</strong> Schools like “Devry University’ or ‘Full Sail University’ emphasize practical skills and industry-relevant training in their programs.</p>
        <p>These institutions often engage in continuous dialogue with industry leaders to ensure that their educational offerings remain aligned with evolving job market requirements.</p>
        <p>This market-driven approach often overlooks critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and creativity, which are essential skills for addressing global challenges.</p>
      <p class="indent">&bull; Technocratic Focus</p>
        <p>The literature review identified a trend towards technocracy in STEM education, where technical expertise is valued above all else. This focus on technical skills often marginalizes other important aspects of education, such as social responsibility, cultural awareness, and ethical considerations.</p>
      <h3>3. Benefits of Transdisciplinary Approaches:</h3>
      <p class="indent">&bull; STEAM Success Stories</p>
        <p>Case studies of institutions like RISD showed that integrating the arts into STEM (STEAM) resulted in higher levels of student engagement and innovation. For example, students who participated in STEAM programs were 30% more likely to pursue interdisciplinary careers and reported higher satisfaction with their educational experience.</p>
      <p class="indent">&bull; Broader skill sets</p>
        <p>Statistical analysis of student outcomes in STEAM programs revealed that these students developed broader skill sets, including enhanced problem-solving abilities, creativity, and the ability to think critically about the social implications of technology.</p>
      <p>These skills are increasingly important in today’s complex, globalized world.</p>

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <h3>1. Addressing Demographic disparities:</h3>
          <p>The findings underscore the urgent need to address the demographic disparities in STEM education. While STEM fields are critical for economic growth and innovation, the underrepresentation of women and minorities limits the diversity of perspectives and ideas, ultimately hindering progress.</p>
          <p>Educational institutions must implement targeted initiatives to support underrepresented groups, such as mentorship programs, scholarships, and outreach efforts to engage students from diverse backgrounds early in their educational journeys.</p>
        <h3>2. Re-evaluating ideological underpinnings: </h3>
          <p>The ideological influences shaping STEM education, particularly the dominance of neoliberal and technocratic values, require critical examination.</p>
          <p>These ideologies, which prioritize market-driven outcomes and technical expertise, often overlook the importance of social responsibility, ethics, and creativity.</p>
          <p>By reorienting STEM education to include these broader considerations, educators can better prepare students to address the multifaceted challenges of the 21st century, such as climate change, inequality, and global health crises.</p>
        <h3>3. The case for transdisciplinary education:</h3>
          <p>The success of transdisciplinary approaches, such as STEAM, highlights the potential for a more holistic and inclusive model of STEM education.</p>
          <p>By integrating the arts and social sciences, STEM programs can foster creativity, critical thinking, and ethical reasoning, which are essential for addressing complex global challenges.</p>
          <p>Moreover, transdisciplinary education can make STEM more accessible and appealing to a broader range of students, particularly those who may feel alienated by traditional, narrowly focused STEM curricula.</p>
        <h3>4. Policy recommendations:</h3>
          <p>To implement these changes, policymakers must take decisive action. This includes increasing funding for programs that support underrepresented groups in STEM, revising curricula to incorporate transdisciplinary elements, and promoting educational models that value diversity and inclusivity.</p>
          <p>Additionally, policies should encourage collaboration between STEM fields and the arts, humanities, and social sciences to create a more well-rounded and socially responsible educational framework.</p>
