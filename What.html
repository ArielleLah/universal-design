    <h2>Concept of Universal Design</h2>
      <p>Universal Design focuses on everyone with a full spectrum of ability and to be a "barrier-free design".  This is achieved by looking cohesive and thoughtful, while also being accessible.  A quick example, could be a cohesive outlined website that screen readers can be interpretted easily.  </p>
    <h2>Inclusion Principle</h2>
      <p>This principle recognizes and supports the intrinsic value of all human beings by creating and sustaining conditions that foster equity, empowerment, awareness and competence at the personal, group and organizational levels.  This is the simple meaning of thinking of all humans as humans and respecting that everyone is different but that everyone should have the same chances.</p>
    <h2>Accessibility vs Universal Design</h2>
      <p>Accessibility is the practice of creating websites that are usable by people of all abilities or disabilities.  This means creating websites that don't block people with assistive technology with the comprehension of the educational content.  This could be due to poor course design or technical incompatibilities. </p>
      <p>Accessibility's main focus is to allow the website to work with assitive technology and making the website accessible to all, but Universal Design ensures accessibility but also focuses on making a nice design that everyone would be pleased to visit the website.</p>

    <h2>Rehabilition Act (Section 508/504)</h2>
      <p>Section 508 mandates that federal agencies make electronic information accessible to members of the public.  This includes university websites, government sites, etc.</p>
      <p>Section 504 is an antidiscrimination measure comparable to the Americans with Disabilities Act(ADA) that addresses an individual's needs.  This focuses on allowing everyone having equal access to all programs, services and activities receiving federal subsidy.</p>  
      <p>The Rehabilition Act helps create standards that should already be implemented throughout the entire world wide web.</p>
