        <h2>7 Principles of Universal Design</h2>
        <h3>1. Equitable Use:</h3>
          <p>The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.  Providing an equal way for your users to access features and information, avoid segregating any group of people because of personal restrictions and/or device capabilities.</p>
          <p>Examples: High Contrast is making sure that the text and the background of the website have a high enough contrast to be easily readable and avoid any problems someone with color blindness might experience. Alt Text allows screen readers or maybe someone whose internet isn't loading the pictures to have some idea of what the picture was referring too.  Mouse-Only Interactions means you can hide some of your information unless someone tabs or mouses over to expand it.  The biggest example would be a navigation bar with like 20 different directions, you can divide that into groups and under that general title, if that's where people want to go it'll show the 5 choices from that category.  Also, another thought is most web traffic comes from phones or tablets that don't even have a mouse to allow the ability to hover, so designing your website with all devices in mind will be more inclusive.</p>
        <h3>2. Flexibility in Use</h3>
          <p> The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.  Mostly giving users a choice on how and when they access features.  This could be as simple as allow your website to be tabbed instead of only reliant on a mouse or graying out choices that aren't available yet.  This keeps the user from being forced into places they donâ€™t want to be.  Also, basically don't rely on a one way approach to navigating your website and allow enough variability to allow the user to chose how they navigate.</p>
          <p>Examples: Scroll Hijacking is when you are basically making the user scroll up and down the page how you expect and not how the user naturally wants to.  This can cause fustration because the user didn't want to scroll down the entire page and cause them to leave. Text Resizing allows the sizing up or down of text within the layout of your website <em>WITHOUT</em> ruining the design or layout of the website.</p>
        <h3>3. Simple and Intuitive Use</h3>
          <p>This means that the use of your design is easy to understand, regardless of experience, knowledge, language skills or current concentration level.  A good design is often defined as being intuitive to what the user needs and the simpler the design is the more likely users are to achieve their goals.  Intuitive means you figure out what your users know, expect, and do, in order for the interface to correctly anticipate and respond to their actions in a way that feels natural, logical and pleasant.  Many users have already created helpful rules, patterns and guidelines you can reference, adapt and reuse.</p>
          <p>This is extremely important because you aren't trying to reinvent the wheel, just use a lot of the "norms" of web design.  For example, most webpages have the navigation at the top or sides and if you tried to go against that users will become fustrated because their current knowledge of the internet is being challenged.</p>
        <h3>4. Perceptible Informtion</h3>
          <p>Perceptible Information means that the design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.  This allows the content of your website to be easy to digest.</p>
          <p>Examples: Information oganization is a bit beyond just having adequate text contrast and sizing, but breaking down your information into bite-sized pieces.  The use of subheadings in a long text will make speed reading and skimming more effective. Graphics are used to emphasize a point you're making in text and helps more visual users. Charts and graphs supply both graph and table views of data which allows users not only the flexibility to choose how to get information, but also help make patterns in the data more readable.</p>
        <h3>5. Tolerance for Error</h3>
          <p>The design needs to minimize hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.  This will help ensure users can't trap themselves in a corner or cause irreversible damage to their information.  Users who are afraid of making a mistake will likely not use your website if it is prone to accidents.</p>
          <p>Examples: Avoid accidents by putting in permanent reminders like "are you sure?" as a confirmation prompt.  An alternative to prompting users all the time is to give them a chance to undo, or retrieve old items.</p>
        <h3>6. Low Physical Effort</h3>
          <p>The design needs to be used efficiently and comfortably with a minimum of fatigue.  There are two aspects to this principle.  The first, don't require your users to go back and forth across the screen to complete a single workflow/task.  The second, is more about causing mental fatigue and the perceived difficulty of the task at hand. </p>
          <p>Examples: Action grouping does exactly what it sounds like, group actions together in a specific area of the screen.  This minimizes the amount of mouse dragging or thumb stretching needed, which helps everyone.  This is especially useful for users with very large screens, or need to have it super-zoomed in and have to scroll through things that would fit normally on a default size.  Minimize requests means not requiring the user to fill out length forms or jump through multiple "hoops" to gain access to their goal.  The less effort required, the more involved the user will be.</p>
        <h3>7. Size and Space for Approach and Use</h3>
          <p>The appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture or mobility.  This ties into keeping your actions grouped together and the use of screen real estate is extremely important to the overall experience inside the application.</p>
          <p>Examples: Action Targets take into account varying hand size and dexterity which is super important in mobile device use.  The actions need to be large enough to click or tap easily and the primary actions within easy reach.  Posture is important because a majority of users are not in a chair, at a desk with a mouse and keyboard, so thinking of the different ways someone could be using the web site should be key to your design.  Dynamic Spaces could be like a virtual key board but those cover part of the screen, so keeping this portion of the screen in mind through all states of design to avoid causing the user to block their own work.</p>
        <h2>Norman's Design Concepts: Affordance, Constraints, Feedback, Visibility</h2>
          <p>Perceived Affordance is how users interpret and percieve the function of a device.  This cues the users towards certain operations.  For example, most websites have a navigation at the top across or left side of websites, so most users would assume you would follow that convention.</p>
          <p>Constraints limit the actions of the users in order to prevent error and misuse of a device.  There are two categories of constraints, which are physical and psychological.  Physical is like trying to shift a car into reverse when you are moving forward, it's physically impossible.  Psychological constraints could also be broken down into 3 different categories, semantic, cultural and logical.  Semantic is an auditory signal that there was something wrong has occured or that it's just powering down.  Think of most electronics have a power down sound to aid in your abililty to know that you actually powered that device down.  Cultural constaints could be like paying for your stuff at a cashier that is usually at the front of the store.  As web users we have learned through convention that the home link or menu item takes us to the home or front page of the site and the navigation will be on the top or side.  Lastly, logical could be you are given like 80% of the information and you can figure out the rest just based on logic.  </p>
          <p>Visibility could be making info graphics of how to do a task but could also be the hiding of information until it is needed.  For example, an operation that can't be performed yet will be grayed out so the user knows they can't accomplish this task yet.  It boils down to making applicable items visible and non-relevant operations invisible.  Feedback is giving that user a way to acknowledge something was initated, it could be like the power off tone of a television.  This could be hiding the options that are unavailable and presenting smaller menus and information that reveal more specifics as the user drills down to more specific areas of the site.  This helps users with context sensitivity and allow a pleasant experience without getting too overwhelmed.  </p>
        <h2>Principles of Interaction Design</h2>
          <p>Aesthetics are the overall look of the design.  However fashion should never trump usability but it should ensure that learnability, satisfaction, and productivity have been improved or at least stayed the same.</p>
          <p>Anticipation is not expecting the user to leave the current screen to search for and collect all necessary information but bringing it to the user each step of the process.  It must be in a place with the tools needed that are present and visible.</p>
          <p>Autonomy allows users to make their own decisions, even if they are aesthetically poor or behaviorally less efficient.  This is achieved by allowing users latitude but exercise necessary control to still enable them to have a pleasant experience.</p>

        <h3>Displaying code Example</h3>
        <p>If you look how everything is structured, and there is a "parent function" for any "child".  Also, everything is indented to help with readability.  Parent elements include: Header, Nav, Main, Section, Article, Aside, Figure and Footer.  Child elements include: Header, Paragraph, List and Figure.</p>
