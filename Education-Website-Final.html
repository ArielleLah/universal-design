      <section id="Conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Universal Design is the best thing to attract the most amount of people to your website and allowing them to have a pleasant experience.  This design isn't targeted at just people with disabilities, but allows the website to be inclusive to everyone without isolating a specific type of user.  This does not make websites boring but it does allow for a better search engine optimization and is easier to adjust overtime.  Universal Design ensures inclusion, while also keeping it visually appealing and helps everyone aquire different knowledge.  </p>

    <p>I am 31 years old, currently serving in the Marine Corps and a full time student at CU Boulder.  I am trying to obtain a Computer Science (BA) Major with a Leadership Minor.  I had no web design experience before starting this class and I believe it was better to learn the "right way" the first time without having any bad habits.  This was an awesome class and I learned a ton of information throughout the semester.  I will be graduating December of 2025.</p>
